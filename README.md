Machine Learning Model Comparison

This project aims to analyze housing prices using various machine-learning algorithms. The dataset used contains multiple features related to housing characteristics, and the goal is to predict the price of houses based on these features.

Project Structure
The project is organized into several key sections, each represented by a cell in the notebook:

Preparation of the Problem:
Libraries are loaded, including pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, and several machine learning models from scikit-learn.
The dataset is loaded from a CSV file named house_price.csv.
Data Exploration:
The first few rows of the dataset are displayed to help you understand its structure and contents.
Descriptive statistics are computed to summarize the central tendency, dispersion, and shape of the dataset's distribution.
Data Visualization:
Various plots are generated to visualize the relationships between features, such as the number of bathrooms and their corresponding prices.
Modelling:
Several regression models are implemented, including Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Regression (SVR).
Model evaluation metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), R-squared, and Explained Variance Score are calculated to assess model performance.
Hyperparameter Tuning:
Grid Search is utilized to optimize model parameters for better accuracy.
